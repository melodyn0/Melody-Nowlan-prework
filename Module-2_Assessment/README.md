# Module 2 Assessment

This is the JavaScript assessment for Module 2. It is a simple Hangman game themed early 2000s. All the hints are a photo of a word or phrase which appears in a hit song from the early 2000s. The answers are all artists which released the hit songs that the photos hint at.

## Files

* [Hangman](index.html) - This is the HTML file with the skeleton of the game code.
* [CSS](assets/css/index.css) - The program is built with Bootstrap, but this is the CSS file I used for other styling.
* [JavaScript](assets/javascript/game.js) - This is the JavaScript code that I used to build the game.
